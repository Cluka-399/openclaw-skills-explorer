The plugin connects OpenClaw with LunaraVox call execution, enabling AI-driven inbound and outbound conversations at scale while keeping business logic and control fully configurable.\n\nThe plugin acts as a bridge between OpenClaw and the LunaraVox calling engine. When an OpenClaw agent initiates a call, the request is sent through the LunaraVox API, where call behavior, greeting logic, and conversational instructions are applied before the call is executed.\n\nThis architecture separates decision-making from call execution:\n\nOpenClaw handles reasoning and task logic.\nLunaraVox handles telephony, voice interaction, and call processing.\n\nThis allows AI agents to perform real-world communication tasks without requiring complex telephony integrations inside OpenClaw itself.\n\n\nCore Capabilities\n\nAI Call Execution\n\nOpenClaw agents can initiate phone calls directly through the LunaraVox API. The system injects predefined behavior prompts, greeting logic, and conversation goals before the call starts.\n\nSupported scenarios include:\n • outbound sales and qualification calls\n • follow-ups and reminders\n • appointment confirmations\n • customer information collection\n • automated campaign calls\n • inbound call handling with AI assistants\n\nThe AI communicates naturally, processes responses in real time, and returns structured results back to the agent.\n\n\n\nCall History & Analytics API\n\nLunaraVox provides a dedicated history API optimized for LLM usage. Instead of loading full conversations, the system allows filtered access to historical call data, reducing token usage and improving response speed.\n\nAvailable filters include:\n • date ranges\n • call duration limits\n • call direction\n • call status and outcomes\n • tagged call categories\n • assistant-specific history\n\nThis allows OpenClaw agents to analyze past calls, identify patterns, and make decisions based on structured historical data rather than raw transcripts.\n\n\n\nDetailed Call Data\n\nFor each call, the agent can retrieve:\n • structured call summary\n • outcome and agreements reached\n • optional transcript\n • audio reference\n • detailed metadata\n\nTranscripts can be excluded when not required, minimizing token consumption.\n\n\n\nPII Protection\n\nThe API automatically detects and masks sensitive information such as phone numbers, emails, and payment data. This ensures that stored call data remains safe for analytics and AI processing without exposing sensitive user information.\n\n\n\nExport for Training and Optimization\n\nCall history can be exported in formats suitable for LLM processing and model training workflows. Businesses can use successful conversations as datasets for improving AI behavior, optimizing scripts, and increasing conversion performance over time.\n\nThis enables iterative improvement based on real successful interactions rather than manual scripting alone.\n\n\n\nArchitecture Overview\n\nThe plugin follows a modular architecture:\n 1. OpenClaw decides when and why a call should be made.\n 2. LunaraVox receives the request via API.\n 3. Behavior prompts and call configuration are applied.\n 4. The AI executes the call through the connected SIP provider.\n 5. Results and analytics are returned to OpenClaw.\n\nThe AI agent itself does not perform telephony — LunaraVox provides the execution layer.\n\nThis separation allows independent scaling of AI logic and call infrastructure.\n\n\n\nRequirements\n\nTo use the plugin, users must:\n • register an account at lunaravox.com\n • connect their own SIP provider\n • purchase a call minutes package (minimum 300 minutes)\n • install and configure the LunaraVox plugin in OpenClaw\n\nSIP costs remain fully controlled by the user and are billed by their telecom provider.\n\n\n\nPricing\n\nLunaraVox usage is billed at:\n\n$4 per active AI hour\n\nNo long-term contracts or platform lock-in.\n\n\nCall connection costs are paid separately to the user’s SIP provider.\n\n\nUse Cases\n • AI sales automation\n • scalable outbound campaigns\n • customer support automation\n • lead qualification\n • appointment scheduling\n • high-volume communication workflows\n\nLunaraVox is designed for businesses that need real phone communication at scale without scaling human operators."}},{"slug":"wechat-article-extractor-skill","displayName":"微信公众号文章解析","summary":"Extract metadata and content from WeChat Official Account articles.

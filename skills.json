into frames (avoids “position is outside parent boundaries”).\n\nArrow-only sticky filtering\n\nRemoves “→ / ->” as stickies (arrows are connectors, not post-its).\n\nHow it pushes to Miro\n\nUses only environment variables (no cookies, no browser session hacks):\n\nMIRO_ACCESS_TOKEN\n\nMIRO_BOARD_ID\n\nExecutes a local script:\n\nnode miro-push.mjs apply <miro-ready.json>\n\nnode miro-push.mjs

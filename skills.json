Without naming why the approach failed and what assumption broke, any pivot is cosmetic. This is Popper applied directly — the failure must be honored as real information before being discarded.\nThe 3 Lenses (Inversion, Analogy, Reduction) give the chaos structure. Fully random alternatives can waste cycles. Philosophically-guided alternatives — borrowed from how humans actually have breakthroughs — stay within the problem domain while being genuinely divergent. Inversion comes from TRIZ methodology, Analogy from how most scientific breakthroughs actually happen, and Reduction from the Unix philosophy and first-principles thinking.\nThe Design Thinking loop gives it the iterative self-correcting structure you asked for. It doesn't just pivot once — it carries accumulated failure data forward so each loop is smarter than the last.\nThe Escalation clause prevents infinite looping.

Baidu Embedding (Conversation Memory)\n- **Auto-recall:** Relevant memories injected before each response using Baidu Embedding-V1 (requires API credentials)\n- **Auto-capture:** Preferences/decisions/facts stored automatically with local vector storage (requires API credentials)\n- **Privacy Focused:** All embeddings processed via Baidu API with local storage\n- **Chinese Optimized:** Better understanding of Chinese language semantics\n- **Tools:** `baidu_memory_recall`, `baidu_memory_store`, `baidu_memory_forget` (require API credentials)\n- **Triggers:** \"remember\", \"prefer\", \"my X is\", \"I like/hate/want\"\n- **Note:** When API credentials are not provided, this layer is unavailable and the system operates in degraded mode.\n\n### 2. Git-Notes Memory (Structured, Local)\n- **Branch-aware:** Memories isolated per git branch\n- **Entity extraction:** Auto-extracts topics, names, concepts\n- **Importance levels:** critical, high, normal, low\n- **No external API calls**\n\n### 3. File Search (Workspace)\n- **Searches:** MEMORY.md, memory/*.md, any workspace file\n- **Script:** `scripts/file-search.sh`\n\n## 🛠️ Setup\n\n### Install Dependencies\n```bash\nclawdhub install git-notes-memory\nclawdhub install memory-baidu-embedding-db\n```\n\n### Configure Baidu API\nSet environment variables:\n```bash\nexport BAIDU_API_STRING='your_bce_v3_api_string'\nexport BAIDU_SECRET_KEY='your_secret_key'\n```\n\n### Create File Search Script\nCopy `scripts/file-search.sh` to your workspace.\n\n## 📖 Usage\n\n### Session Start (Always)\n```bash\npython3 skills/git-notes-memory/memory.py -p $WORKSPACE sync --start\n```\n\n### Store Important Decisions\n```bash\npython3 skills/git-notes-memory/memory.py -p $WORKSPACE remember \\\n  '{\"decision\": \"Use PostgreSQL\", \"reason\": \"Team expertise\"}' \\\n  -t architecture,database -i h\n```\n\n### Search Workspace Files\n```bash\n./scripts/file-search.sh \"database config\" 5\n```\n\n### Baidu Embedding Memory (Automatic)\nBaidu Embedding handles this automatically when API credentials are available. Manual tools:\n- `baidu_memory_recall \"query\"` - search conversation memory using Baidu vectors (requires API credentials)\n- `baidu_memory_store \"text\"` - manually store something with Baidu embedding (requires API credentials)\n- `baidu_memory_forget` - delete memories (GDPR, requires API credentials)\n\n**In Degraded Mode** (without API credentials):\n- System operates using only Git-Notes and File System layers\n- Manual tools are unavailable\n- Auto-recall and auto-capture are disabled\n\n## 🎯 Importance Levels\n\n| Flag | Level | When to Use |\n|------|-------|-------------|\n| `-i c` | Critical | \"always remember\", explicit preferences |\n| `-i h` | High | Decisions, corrections, preferences |\n| `-i n` | Normal | General information |\n| `-i l` | Low | Temporary notes |\n\n## 📋 When to Use Each System\n\n| System | Use For |\n|--------|---------|\n| **Baidu Embedding** | Conversation context, auto-retrieval with privacy |\n| **Git-Notes** | Structured decisions, searchable by entity/tag |\n| **File Search** | Workspace docs, daily logs, MEMORY.md |\n\n## 📁 File Structure\n\n```\nworkspace/\n├── MEMORY.md              # Long-term curated memory\n├── memory/\n│   ├── active-context.md  # Current session state\n│   └── YYYY-MM-DD.md      # Daily logs\n├── scripts/\n│   └── file-search.sh     # Workspace search\n└── skills/\n    ├── triple-memory-baidu-embedding/  # Enhanced memory system\n    ├── git-notes-memory/  # Structured memory\n    └── memory-baidu-embedding-db/  # Vector storage\n```\n\n## 🔧 Hook Integration\n\nThis skill can be integrated with Clawdbot's startup hooks for automatic initialization:\n\n### Memory Boot Hook Integration\nTo ensure the Triple Memory Baidu system starts automatically when the gateway starts:\n\n1. The `memory-boot-loader` hook can be configured to run `/root/clawd/session-init-triple-baidu.sh`\n2. This ensures all three memory layers are initialized on startup\n3. Provides immediate access to Git-Notes, Baidu Embedding, and file-based memory\n\n### Configuration\nThe system can be integrated with the gateway startup sequence to ensure:\n- Git-Notes synchronization on startup\n- Baidu Embedding connection check\n- File-based memory initialization\n- Ready-to-use memory system from the start\n\n## 🤫 Silent Operation\n\nNever announce memory operations to users. Just do it:\n- ❌ \"I'll remember this\"\n- ❌ \"Saving to memory\"\n- ✅ (silently store and continue)\n\n## 🔄 Migration from Original Triple Memory\n\n1. **Install this skill** in your `skills/` directory\n2. **Configure your Baidu API credentials**\n3. **Disable original triple-memory** if desired\n4. **Update your bot configuration** to use this memory system\n5. **Verify data integrity** and performance\n\n## 📈 Performance Benefits\n\n- **Enhanced Privacy**: All vector storage local with Baidu API\n- **Better Chinese Support**: Baidu Embedding optimized for Chinese\n- **Reduced Costs**: Potentially lower API costs compared to OpenAI\n- **Same Architecture**: Maintains proven three-tier design\n\n## 🤝 Contributing\n\nBased on original Triple Memory system by Clawdbot Team. Contributions welcome to enhance the Baidu Embedding integration.\n\n## 📄 License\n\nOriginal license applies with modifications noted above.
